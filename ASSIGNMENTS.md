<!--- ## FINAL GAME PROJECT (Proposals Due: Thursday, November 14th; Final Due: Tuesday, December 3rd)

You will make a game using one of the methods or tools covered in class, or a pre-approved game making software of your choice. This game can be about any subject, and may build upon games previously completed for class (expanded versions of previous assignments).

Your final game project should reflect subjects covered in previous weeks by addressing one (or more) of the following:

- Sicart's "game characteristics"
- Makes use of restrictions to complicate/vary gameplay (i.e., the one-button game, two color game)
- "Serious Games" (games that educate, or serve a purpose other than solely entertainment)
- Solo gaming
- Collaborative gaming (i.e., TTRPGs with collaborative storytelling, map-making, etc.)

Steps:

1. Write a short proposal that explains briefly your goals for your game, and which of the above it addresses. We will discuss these in class (November 14). (Note: you can start working on the game itself before then, but a short description of the game with notes is "best practices" and will help in the planning process). Include a justification for the method/tools you will use to construct the game.

2. Keep a development journal for your game. It doesn't need to be long or in-depth, but should log the time you spent working on it, and your wins or frustrations during the process. This is also "best practices" and provides helpful tips for yourself when engaging with the project both in the present and future.

3. When you "finish" the game, export it so others can play it (i.e., as an .html file, several printed copies, etc.). We will use these to play test during the final week of class.


## SOLO TTRPG (Table Top Role-Playing Game) ASSIGNMENT (Due Thursday, November 7th!)

Try your hand at writing a one-page TTRPG! 

Some tips:

- Decide what kind of game you want to make first. Do you want it to be sci-fi, rom-com, horror, fantasy?  
- What will the player leave play with? Does it lead a player in creating a poem, a sketch, a dungeon, or a journal entry?  
- Directed solo games often work much like a choose-your-own-adventure book where you play through a solid story arc whose events change slightly with each replay but generally comes to the same end.  
- Open solo games generally give the player a toolset to creatively bounce off of (like a table of prompts or questions) so that they will get a unique story.  
- PLAY A FEW GAMES SEVERAL TIMES. See what kind of solo games you like, and which you don't.  

Here are some tools to help you get started:

## THREE COLOR GAME ASSIGNMENT (Due: 10.29.24)

Creating a game with restrictions is not only a design challenge meant to consider what constitutes meaningful interactivity (see Saten & Zimmerman) but also forces a game developer to consider disability and gaming. 

- Because of mobility challenges, some gamers find it difficult to master the crazy button-mashing of some AAA games (that is, the big game companies that make some of the most popular games). A one-button game would be far more accessible to this kind of gamer.

- Consider the challenges of the blind or visually impaired: a game that could be read using text-to-speech software can be deeply involving (for example, some of the gamers in the documentary Get Lamp professed a deep love for early text adventures). 

- Visually impaired but still-sighted gamers might be able to see games that use high contrast in light and dark. Pixel games that use black and white are more accessible than games that employ more "realistic" graphics.

(For more on designing for gamers with disabilities: https://playabilityinitiative.com/).

Your assignment is to construct a TWO or THREE COLOR GAME USING BITSY (https://bitsy.org/). 

Consider how to limit your palette to two contrasting colors while integrating the restricted palette with a narrative/game mechanic. 

1. Consult Bitsy and the Shimmerwitch tutorial:

- Bitsy (https://bitsy.org/)
- https://www.shimmerwitch.space/bitsyTutorial.html

2. Keep it simple!

No matter how short, a game with a very simple premise could be very gratifying. Don't feel the need to create a sprawling narrative with multiple characters and scenes! 

Tips:

For a two/three-color game: consider circumstances where you would be limited to light and dark vision (perhaps in the dark, underwater). Consider the use of patterns, silhouettes, and well-timed movement.

A template you can use for Twine Macros and Styling: [Macro_Madness.html](readings/Macro_Madness.html)

Exercise goals:

-	Construct branching narratives/non-linear narratives for interactive play using simple coding techniques (involving Twine, adapting HTML, CSS, etc.)
-	Practice creating different modes of interactivity through text and moving images
-	Think about different narrative structures (picaresque, gauntlet, quest, branch-and-bottleneck, etc.) 
-	Understand distinctions between “performance” and “performative”; critiquing types and effectiveness of interactivity

Instructions:
Using Twine, write a branching story with one or more of the following features:

1. Non-human (or better, non-animal) main character
2. Events out of chronological order
3. Multiple characters
4. Poem, not prose

Possibly avoid: life simulator, choose your own adventure tropes (walking around in a fictional world, fighting, dying etc.).

Requirements:
- Use the Twine Cookbook for additional help: https://twinery.org/cookbook/
- Use the Twine non-linear story platform to create a game.
- You can use the downloaded or online version. If you use the online version, you must save your work by choosing the “Publish to File” option in the settings tab. This will download a .html file that can be opened on any computer.

## Game Analysis Presentation (Due: Week 4, 9.18)

Format: 
- ~5 minutes long
- use Google Slides for images
- videos less than 30 seconds (short clips, please!)

The presentation should include:

- a short introduction: how did you find this game? Why does it appeal to you? What kind of game is this?
- a short explanation of how the game is played
- The analysis:

Choose three of the following of Sicart's game characteristics, and explain how your game fulfills (or thwarts!) them. 

1. Play is contextual. (6)
2. Play is carnivalesque. (11)
3. Play is appropriative. (11)
4. Play is disruptive. (14)
5. Play is autotelic. (16)
6. Play is creative. (17)
7. Play is personal. (17)

- Conclusion: is there anything you'd like to change about the game? Are there house rules you use, or rules/aspects of this game that you apply to other games?

Tips:

- Consider how language is used around the game (Huizinga, Chapter 2). How do people refer to the game (does it have particular words associated with it? Are there memes associated with it (consider "Among Us" and the word "sus", for example). Does the game have made up words or concepts? Does it have a specialized lingo associated with it?
- Consider how this game may have impacted history and/or culture (Huizinga, Chapter 3). Is there some larger concept that this game mimics/represents/parodies (example: Katamari Damacy is a commentary on capitalism).
